This repository showcases a Python function that demonstrates an uncommon error: a ZeroDivisionError that does not always occur because it depends on unpredictable input values.  The function divides by 'a', but only when 'a' is zero.  If 'a' is not always zero in the function's input, the error can be difficult to reproduce consistently. The solution demonstrates how to add robust error handling for such scenarios.
